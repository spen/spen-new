In this project I wanted to explore the idea of using a mobile device to engage directly with a screen in a window display, without having to add any expensive specialist hardware.

The display has an idle state, showing a slide-show of various properties with some basic details & images of each property.
Then, either by scanning a QR code, or entering a code in to a web app, the user is automatically connected & synced up with the display. From here the user can interact with the display, either by progressing through the properties, looking at different images or by taking a virtual tour through the property.
