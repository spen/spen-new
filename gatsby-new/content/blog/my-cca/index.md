I worked on an internal B2B platform for CCA for a 3 week contract to help wrangle the front-end codebase. The front-end was built with jQuery and had become difficult to manage and had started to showing inconsistent state across different
areas of the UI.

I decided to add a thin backbone.js layer, allowing the team to incrementally move state items in to a dedicated state layer. I layed out some documentation and guidelines for how to transition areas of the app to work with backbone.js and the state layer it provided so that the offshore team could follow some simple patterns after I was gone and worked through some examples while I was still available.
