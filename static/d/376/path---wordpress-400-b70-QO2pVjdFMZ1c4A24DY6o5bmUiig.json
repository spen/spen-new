I started contributing to the project while I was learning the ropes of react and ended up sticking around to work on it full-time.</p>\n<p>You can find a list of my contributions to wp-calypso <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aspen+is%3Aclosed\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Onboarding</h3>\n<p>I was part of the team responsible for rebuilding WordPress.com’s signup flow, building in new features such as importing existing content from other sources (Wix, SquareSpace, tumblr etc), designing a starter site based on options and answers given XXXXX.</p>\n<p>This project came wih a number of challenges…</p>\n<h3>Flux -> Redux</h3>\n<p>One area that I focused on both before and after joining Automattic full-time was ‘reduxifying’ parts of calypso’s state, with the goal of removing Flux.JS and Immutable.JS from the codebase altogether. It was a lengthy process but allowed us to simplify much of the state logic across the app.</p>\n<h3>Auto-translate in HappyChat</h3>\n<p>To provide quicker support to customers whose languages weren’t officially supported by policy wwe streamlined the translating process by detecting and translating as messages came in to our internal chat app ‘HappyChat’.\nUntil this point our support engineers would have to keep translations in a separate browser tab, making the process cumbersome and slow.\nWe didn’t launch two-way translation right away as there were concerns about bad or offensive translations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./translate-1.png=250x\" alt=\"app-preferences\"></p>\n<h2>Remote By Default</h2>\n<!-- The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad\nCommas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text\ndidn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and\nmade herself on the way.\n\n- This however showed weasel\n- Well uncritical so misled\n  - this is very interesting\n- Goodness much until that fluid owl\n\nWhen she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last\nview back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of\n[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line\nLane.
